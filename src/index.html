    <h2> Below is an inpirational poem  by Walter D. Wintle </h2>
    
  
 
<h3>
  <p>If you think you are beaten, you are</p>
    <p>If you think you dare not, you don't,</p>
    <p>If you like to win, but you think you can't</p>
    <p>It is almost certain you won't.</b></p>

   <p> <b>If you think you'll lose, you're lost</p>
    <p>For out of the world we find,</p>
    <p>Success begins with a fellow's will</p>
     <p>It's all in the state of mind.</p>

    <p>If you think you are outclassed, you are</p>
    <p>You've got to think high to rise,</p>
    <p>You've got to be sure of yourself before</p>
      <p>You can ever win a prize.</p>

   <p><b>Life's battles don't always go</p>
    <p>To the stronger or faster man,</p>
    <p>But soon or late the man who wins</p>
     <p>Is the man WHO THINKS HE CAN!‚Äù</p> </h3>

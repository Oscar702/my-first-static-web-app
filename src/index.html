    <h2> Below is an inpirational poem  by Walter D. Wintle </h2>
    
  
 
<h3>
  <p> <b>If you think you are beaten, you are</b>
    <b>If you think you dare not, you don't,</b>
    <b>If you like to win, but you think you can't</b>
    <b>It is almost certain you won't.</b></p>

   <p> <b>If you think you'll lose, you're lost</b>
    <b>For out of the world we find,</b>
    <b>Success begins with a fellow's will</b>
     <b>It's all in the state of mind.</b></p>

    <p><b>If you think you are outclassed, you are</b>
    <b>You've got to think high to rise,</b>
    <b>You've got to be sure of yourself before</b>
      <b>You can ever win a prize.</b></p>

   <p><b>Life's battles don't always go</b>
    <b>To the stronger or faster man,</b>
    <b>But soon or late the man who wins</b>
     <b>Is the man WHO THINKS HE CAN!‚Äù</b></p> </h3>
